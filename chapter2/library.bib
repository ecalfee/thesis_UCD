 abstractNote={Background The spread of maize cultivation to the highlands of central Mexico was accompanied by substantial introgression from the endemic wild teosinte Zea mays ssp. mexicana, prompting the hypothesis that the transfer of beneficial variation facilitated local adaptation. Methods We used whole-genome sequence data to map regions of Zea mays ssp. mexicana introgression in three Mexican highland maize individuals. We generated a genetic linkage map and performed Quantitative Trait Locus mapping in an F2 population derived from a cross between lowland and highland maize individuals. Results Introgression regions ranged in size from several hundred base pairs to Megabase-scale events. Gene density within introgression regions was comparable to the genome as a whole, and over 1,000 annotated genes were located within introgression events. Quantitative Trait Locus mapping identified a small number of loci linked to traits characteristic of Mexican highland maize. Discussion Although there was no strong evidence to associate quantitative trait loci with regions of introgression, we nonetheless identified many Mexican highland alleles of introgressed origin that carry potentially functional sequence variants. The impact of introgression on stress tolerance and yield in the highland environment remains to be fully characterized.},

          Convergent phenotypic evolution provides some of the strongest evidence for adaptation. However, the extent to which recurrent phenotypic adaptation has arisen via parallelism at the molecular level remains unresolved, as does the evolutionary origin of alleles underlying such adaptation. Here, we investigate genetic mechanisms of convergent highland adaptation in maize landrace populations and evaluate the genetic sources of recurrently selected alleles. Population branch excess statistics reveal strong evidence of parallel adaptation at the level of individual SNPs, genes and pathways in four independent highland maize populations, even though most SNPs show unique patterns of local adaptation. The majority of selected SNPs originated via migration from a single population, most likely in the Mesoamerican highlands. Polygenic adaptation analyses of quantitative traits reveal that alleles affecting flowering time are significantly associated with elevation, indicating the flowering time pathway was targeted by highland adaptation. In addition, repeatedly selected genes were significantly enriched in the flowering time pathway, indicating their significance in adapting to highland conditions. Overall, our study system represents a promising model to study convergent evolution in plants with potential applications to crop adaptation across environmental gradients.},

Yet, much has to be discovered on its environmental drivers, the underlying functional traits and their molecular determinants. Genome scans are popular to uncover outlier loci potentially involved in the genetic architecture of local adaptation, however links between outliers and phenotypic variation are rarely addressed. Here we focused on adaptation of teosinte populations along two elevation gradients in Mexico that display continuous environmental changes at a short geographical scale. We used two common gardens, and phenotyped 18 traits in 1664 plants from 11 populations of annual teosintes. In parallel, we genotyped these plants for 38 microsatellite markers as well as for 171 outlier single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that displayed excess of allele differentiation between pairs of lowland and highland populations and/or correlation with environmental variables. Our results revealed that phenotypic differentiation at 10 out of the 18 traits was driven by local selection. Trait covariation along the elevation gradient indicated that adaptation to altitude results from the assembly of multiple co-adapted traits into a complex syndrome: as elevation increases, plants flower earlier, produce less tillers, display lower stomata density and carry larger, longer and heavier grains. The proportion of outlier SNPs associating with phenotypic variation, however, largely depended on whether we considered a neutral structure with 5 genetic groups (73.7\%) or 11 populations (13.5\%), indicating that population stratification greatly affected our results. Finally, chromosomal inversions were enriched for both SNPs whose allele frequencies shifted along elevation as well as phenotypically-associated SNPs. Altogether, our results are consistent with the establishment of an altitudinal syndrome promoted by local selective forces in teosinte populations in spite of detectable gene flow. Because elevation mimics climate change through space, SNPs that we found underlying phenotypic variation at adaptive traits may be relevant for future maize breeding.}, number={12}, journal={PLOS Genetics}, publisher={Public Library of Science}, author={Fustier, Margaux-Alison and Martínez-Ainsworth, Natalia E. and Aguirre-Liguori, Jonás A. and Venon, Anthony and Corti, Hélène and Rousselet, Agnès and Dumas, Fabrice and Dittberner, Hannes and Camarena, María G. and Grimanelli, Daniel and et al.}, year={2019}, month={Dec}, pages={e1008512} }

Based on flowering phenology, maize to mexicana introgression should be very uncommon because maize flowers first and pollen precedes flowering -- so F1s are more likely going to end up planted in a field of maize than out in a population of teosinte to backcross. Looked for high (over 50%) admixture regions using STRUCTURE and HAPMIX with more shared regions across populations in the direction of introgression mexicana into maize. Likelihood estimate is 174 generations since admixture into maize. Domestication alleles were less likely to introgress than average (including tb1 and a pollen-pistil incompatibility locus). Of nine shared introgression regions, 5 have zero diversity (could be shared haplotype commonly introgressed). Introgression is enriched in QTLs for highland adapted traits, incluidng anthocyanin content and macrohairs, possibly with elevation correlations, and they used natural genetic variation in these regions to confirm phenotypes using growth chamber experiments (but can't separate other genomic influences since it's the whole seed grown). Some comparative evidence that mexicana haplotypes contribute to other domesticated lines of maize outside of mexico -- but more dense markers would clarify this finding. Most problematic is that their markers were ascertained in a maize SNP panel - so potentially biased and low resolution. A problem that won't go away is that truly allopatric mexicana for it's evolutionary history is hard to find, and may not exist. Findings support theory that introgression should mostly be in the direction local to invasive.}

We used a set of 468 SNPs to characterize fine‐scale genetic structure within and between two dense stands of the wild ancestor of maize, teosinte (Zea mays ssp. parviglumis). Our analyses confirmed that teosinte is highly outcrossing and showed little population structure over short distances. We found that the two populations were clearly genetically differentiated, although the actual level of differentiation was low. Spatial autocorrelation of relatedness was observed within both sites but was somewhat stronger in one of the populations. Using principal component analysis, we found evidence for significant local differentiation in the population with stronger spatial autocorrelation. This differentiation was associated with pronounced shifts in the first two principal components along the field. These shifts corresponded to changes in allele frequencies, potentially due to local topographical features. There was little evidence for selection at individual loci as a contributing factor to differentiation. Our results demonstrate that significant local differentiation may, but need not, co‐occur with spatial autocorrelation of relatedness. The present study represents one of the most detailed analyses of local genetic structure to date and provides a benchmark for future studies dealing with fine scale patterns of genetic diversity in natural plant populations.}, journal={Molecular ecology}, author={van Heerwaarden, Joost and Ross-Ibarra, J. and Doebley, J. and Glaubitz, Jeffrey C. and Gonzalez, Jose de Jesus Sanchez and Gaut, Brandon S. and Eguiarte, Luis E.}, year={2010} }

To study the ecogeographic distribution of teosinte we constructed a robust database of 2363 teosinte occurrences from published sources for the period 1842–2016. A geographical information system integrating 216 environmental variables was created for Mexico and Central America and was used to characterize the environment of each teosinte occurrence site. The natural geographic distribution of teosinte extends from the Western Sierra Madre of the State of Chihuahua, Mexico to the Pacific coast of Nicaragua and Costa Rica, including practically the entire western part of Mesoamerica. The Mexican annuals Zea mays ssp. parviglumis and Zea mays ssp. mexicana show a wide distribution in Mexico, while Zea diploperennis, Zea luxurians, Zea perennis, Zea mays ssp. huehuetenangensis, Zea vespertilio and Zea nicaraguensis had more restricted and distinct ranges, representing less than 20\% of the total occurrences. Only 11.2\% of teosinte populations are found in Protected Natural Areas in Mexico and Central America. Ecogeographical analysis showed that teosinte can cope with extreme levels of precipitation and temperatures during growing season. Modelling teosinte geographic distribution demonstrated congruence between actual and potential distributions; however, some areas with no occurrences appear to be within the range of adaptation of teosintes. Field surveys should be prioritized to such regions to accelerate the discovery of unknown populations. Potential areas for teosintes Zea mays ssp. mexicana races Chalco, Nobogame, and Durango, Zea mays ssp. huehuetenangensis, Zea luxurians, Zea diploperennis and Zea nicaraguensis are geographically separated; however, partial overlapping occurs between Zea mays ssp. parviglumis and Zea perennis, between Zea mays ssp. parviglumis and Zea diploperennis, and between Zea mays ssp. mexicana race Chalco and Zea mays ssp. mexicana race Central Plateau. Assessing priority of collecting for conservation showed that permanent monitoring programs and in-situ conservation projects with participation of local farmer communities are critically needed; Zea mays ssp. mexicana (races Durango and Nobogame), Zea luxurians, Zea diploperennis, Zea perennis and Zea vespertilio should be considered as the highest priority taxa.}, number={2}, journal={PLOS ONE}, publisher={Public Library of Science}, author={González, José de Jesús Sánchez and Corral, José Ariel Ruiz and García, Guillermo Medina and Ojeda, Gabriela Ramírez and Larios, Lino De la Cruz and Holland, James Brendan and Medrano, Roberto Miranda and Romero, Giovanni Emmanuel García}, year={2018}, month={Feb}, pages={e0192676},

New method to infer kinship and relatives in GWAS samples from admixed populations; turns out admixture alone isn't a problem but population structure pre or post admixture is. The problem is that population structure and assortative mating within admixed populations increase IBD sharing between unrelated individuals with similar ancestry (under the assumption of homogeneous population mixing). Alleles can be identical by state due to recent shared ancestry (identical by descent) or independent probabilities of getting the same allele by chance from random mating. The REAP method calculates kinship at a locus (IBD) using the observed identical-by-state between a pair of individuals fit to a model of the probability of identical-by-state conditional on both individual's genomewide admixture proportions and the allele frequencies in the ancestral source populations. Figure 1 shows how controlling for ancestry, the REAP method eliminates false positives for relatives and incorrect negative kinship for non-relatives of different ancestry..

The goal is to standardize allele frequencies while accounting for sampling bias and relatedness of populations. Within the multivariate normal framework, the variance-covariance matrix is now decomposed using a Cholesky decomposition (to Lagrangian) and allele frequencies are standardized with a constant while rotating with the cholesky factor C-1 matrix both the allele frequencies and environmental variable (Y).
I don't understand the problem with the multivariate normal approximation now why the empirical distribution would differ so much from the expected chi-squared distribution, making it challenging to use a chi-squared statistic for outliers. I also want to better understand the relationship between this model and a linear mixed-model approach for controlling for kinship in a GWAS. Why would you want to run XTX on individuals instead of sample allele frequencies? (I mean other than just capturing within-population structure so you don't need to assume random mating...but does this really make sense if the environmental variable is measured at the population level?).
At the end this paper suggests trying to deal with parallel adaptation by looking at the gene or pathway level. For example, my thought it do high altitude populations have increased drift at certain genes (even if allele frequencies aren't going the same way -- imagine you're looking at linked neutral sites) compared to low altitude populations? this assumes the same genes aren't selected different directison for low and high altitude..I'm not sure what else you would do.}

 DOI={10.1101/2021.01.25.426574}, 
 abstractNote={<p>After domestication from lowland teosinte parviglumis (Zea mays ssp. parviglumis) in the warm Mexican southwest, maize (Zea mays ssp. mays) colonized the highlands of Mexico and South America. In the highlands, maize was exposed to lower temperatures that imposed strong selection on flowering time. Phospholipids are important metabolites in plant responses to low-temperature, low phosphorus availability and have also been suggested to influence flowering time. Here, we combined linkage mapping analysis with genome scans to identify High PhosphatidylCholine 1 (HPC1), a gene which encodes a phospholipase A1 enzyme, as a major driver of phospholipid variation in highland maize. Common garden experiments demonstrated strong genotype-by-environment interactions associated with variation at HPC1, with the highland HPC1 allele leading to higher fitness in highlands, possibly by hastening flowering. The HPC1 variant we identified in highland maize results in impaired function of the encoded protein due to a polymorphism in a highly conserved sequence. A meta-analysis indicated a strong association between the identity of the amino acid at this position and optimal growth in prokaryotes. Mutagenesis of HPC1 via genome editing validated its role in regulating phospholipid metabolism. Finally, we show that the highland HPC1 allele entered cultivated maize by introgression from the wild highland teosinte Zea mays ssp. mexicana and has been maintained in maize breeding lines from Northern US, Canada and Europe. Thus, HPC1 introgressed from teosinte mexicana underlies a large metabolic QTL that modulates phosphatidylcholine levels and has an adaptive effect at least in part via induction of early flowering time.</p>},

In early-flowering maize we detected a CACTA-like transposable element (TE) within the ZmCCT promoter that dramatically reduced flowering time. TE insertion likely occurred after domestication and was selected as maize adapted to temperate zones. This process resulted in a strong selective sweep within the TE-related block of linkage disequilibrium.

They have tremendous economic potential as a genetic mechanism for controlling fertilization without controlling pollination. Three major genetically distinct and functionally equivalent cross-incompatibility systems exist in Zea mays: Ga1, Tcb1, and Ga2. All three confer reproductive isolation between maize or teosinte varieties with different haplotypes at any one locus. These loci confer genetically separable functions to the silk and pollen: a female function that allows the silk to block fertilization by non-self-type pollen and a male function that overcomes the block of the female function from the same locus. Identification of some of these genes has shed light on the reproductive isolation they confer. The identification of both male and female factors as pectin methylesterases reveals the importance of pectin methylesterase activity in controlling the decision between pollen acceptance versus rejection, possibly by regulating the degree of methylesterification of the pollen tube cell wall. The appropriate level and spatial distribution of pectin methylesterification is critical for pollen tube growth and is affected by both pectin methylesterases and pectin methylesterase inhibitors. We present a molecular model that explains how cross-incompatibility systems may function that can be tested in Zea and uncharacterized cross-incompatibility systems. Molecular characterization of these loci in conjunction with further refinement of the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms will allow researchers to bring new and powerful tools to bear on understanding reproductive isolation in Zea mays and related species.}, number={3}, journal={Plant Reproduction}, author={Lu, Yongxian and Moran Lauter, Adrienne N. and Makkena, Srilakshmi and Scott, M.

Domesticated sorghums harbor three different mutations at the Sh1 locus. Variants at regulatory sites in the promoter and intronic regions lead to a low level of expression, a 2.2-kb deletion causes a truncated transcript that lacks exons 2 and 3, and a GT-to-GG splice-site variant in the intron 4 results in removal of the exon 4. The distributions of these non-shattering haplotypes among sorghum landraces suggest three independent origins.

When maize was domesticated from teosinte, the number and arrangement of ears changed dramatically. Teosinte has long lateral branches that bear multiple small ears at their nodes and tassels at their tips. Maize has much shorter lateral branches that are tipped by a single large ear with no additional ears at the branch nodes. To investigate the genetic basis of this difference in prolificacy (the number of ears on a plant), we performed a genome-wide QTL scan. A large effect QTL for prolificacy (prol1.1) was detected on the short arm of chromosome 1 in a location that has previously been shown to influence multiple domestication traits. We fine-mapped prol1.1 to a 2.7 kb “causative region” upstream of the grassy tillers1 (gt1) gene, which encodes a homeodomain leucine zipper transcription factor. Tissue in situ hybridizations reveal that the maize allele of prol1.1 is associated with up-regulation of gt1 expression in the nodal plexus. Given that maize does not initiate secondary ear buds, the expression of gt1 in the nodal plexus in maize may suppress their initiation. Population genetic analyses indicate positive selection on the maize allele of prol1.1, causing a partial sweep that fixed the maize allele throughout most of domesticated maize. This work shows how a subtle cis-regulatory change in tissue specific gene expression altered plant architecture in a way that improved the harvestability of maize., Crop species underwent profound transformations in morphology during domestication. Among crops, maize experienced a more striking change in morphology than other crops. Among the changes in maize from its ancestor, teosinte, was a switch from 100 or more small ears per plant in teosinte to just one or two large ears in maize. We show that this change in ear number has a relatively simple genetic architecture involving a gene of large effect, called grassy tillers1. Moreover, we show that grassy tillers1 experienced a tissue-specific gain in expression in maize that is associated with suppressing the initiation of multiple ears per plant such that only one or two large ears are formed.

For more than 6,000 years, Native Americans and modern breeders have exploited the tremendous genetic diversity of maize (Zea mays ssp. mays) to create the highest yielding grain crop in the world. Nonetheless, some loci have relatively low levels of genetic variation, particularly loci that have been the target of artificial selection, like c1 and tb1. However, there is limited information on how selection may affect an agronomically important pathway for any crop. These pathways may retain the signature of artificial selection and may lack genetic variation in contrast to the rest of the genome. To evaluate the impact of selection across an agronomically important pathway, we surveyed nucleotide diversity at six major genes involved in starch metabolism and found unusually low genetic diversity and strong evidence of selection. Low diversity in these critical genes suggests that a paradigm shift may be required for future maize breeding.

Regression and interval mapping analyses gave largely congruent results concerning the numbers of loci controlling the morphological traits and the magnitudes of their effects; however, interval mapping tended to give larger estimates for the magnitudes of the effects of the morphological trait loci. This tendency was exaggerated for traits that were non-normally distributed. Variation for most inflorescence traits is controlled by one or two regions of the genome with large effects plus several other regions with relatively small effects. As such, the data are congruent with a mode of inheritance for most traits involving one or two major loci plus several minor loci. Regions of the genome with large effects on one trait consistently had smaller effects on several other traits, possibly as a result of pleiotropy. Most of the variation for the dramatic differences in inflorescence morphology between maize and teosinte is explained by five restricted regions of the genome.

For traits that measure the architectural differences between maize and teosinte, the two F2 populations possessed similar suites of QTLs. For traits that measure components of yield, substantially different suites of QTLs were identified in the two populations.

We found statistically significant associations between several quantitative traits and copy number of both zfl genes in several maize genetic backgrounds. Despite overlap in traits associated with these duplicate genes, zfl1 showed stronger associations with flowering time, while zfl2 associated more strongly with branching and inflorescence structure traits, suggesting some divergence of function. Since zfl2 associates with quantitative variation for ear rank and also maps near a quantitative trait locus (QTL) on chromosome 2 controlling ear rank differences between maize and teosinte, we tested whether zfl2 might have been involved in the evolution of this trait using a QTL complementation test.

Thus, inflorescence architecture reflects meristem number, arrangement and activity, and the duration of meristem activity correlates with branch length. The inflorescences of maize, unlike those of related grasses such as rice and sorghum, predominantly lack long branches, giving rise to the tassel and familiar corncob. Here we report the isolation of the maize ramosa1 gene and show that it controls inflorescence architecture. Through its expression in a boundary domain near the nascent meristem base, ramosa1 imposes short branch identity as branch meristems are initiated. A second gene, ramosa2, acts through ramosa1 by regulating ramosa1 gene expression levels. ramosa1 encodes a transcription factor that appears to be absent in rice, is heterochronically expressed in sorghum, and may have played an important role in maize domestication and grass evolution.}, number={70547054}, journal={Nature}, publisher={Nature Publishing Group}, author={Vollbrecht, Erik and Springer, Patricia S. and Goh, Lindee and Buckler Iv, Edward S. and Martienssen, Robert}, year={2005}, month={Aug}, pages={1119–1126} }

Genes thought to have been selected upon during the domestication of crops are commonly known as domestication loci. The ramosa1 (ra1) gene encodes a putative transcription factor that controls branching architecture in the maize tassel and ear. Previous work demonstrated reduced nucleotide diversity in a segment of the ra1 gene in a survey of modern maize inbreds, indicating that positive selection occurred at some point in time since maize diverged from its common ancestor with the sister species Tripsacum dactyloides and prompting the hypothesis that ra1 may be a domestication gene. To investigate this hypothesis, we examined ear phenotypes resulting from minor changes in ra1 activity and sampled nucleotide diversity of ra1 across the phylogenetic spectrum between tripsacum and maize, including a broad panel of teosintes and unimproved maize landraces. Weak mutant alleles of ra1 showed subtle effects in the ear, including crooked rows of kernels due to the occasional formation of extra spikelets, correlating a plausible, selected trait with subtle variations in gene activity. Nucleotide diversity was significantly reduced for maize landraces but not for teosintes, and statistical tests implied directional selection on ra1 consistent with the hypothesis that ra1 is a domestication locus. In maize landraces, a noncoding 3′-segment contained almost no genetic diversity and 5′-flanking diversity was greatly reduced, suggesting that a regulatory element may have been a target of selection.}, number={7}, journal={Molecular Ecology}, author={Sigmon, Brandi and Vollbrecht, Erik}, year={2010}, pages={1296–1311} }

Here, we report the isolation of the barren stalk1 gene, which encodes a non-canonical basic helix–loop–helix protein required for the initiation of all aerial lateral meristems in maize. barren stalk1 represents one of the earliest genes involved in the patterning of maize inflorescences, and, together with the teosinte branched1 gene4, it regulates vegetative lateral meristem development. The architecture of maize has been a major target of selection for early agriculturalists and modern farmers, because it influences harvesting, breeding strategies and mechanization. By sampling nucleotide diversity in the barren stalk1 region, we show that two haplotypes entered the maize gene pool from its wild progenitor, teosinte, and that only one was incorporated throughout modern inbreds, suggesting that barren stalk1 was selected for agronomic purposes.}, number={70177017}, journal={Nature}, publisher={Nature Publishing Group}, author={Gallavotti, Andrea and Zhao, Qiong and Kyozuka, Junko and Meeley, Robert B. and Ritter, Matthew K. and Doebley, John F. and Enrico Pè, M. and Schmidt, Robert J.}, year={2004}, month={Dec}, pages={630–635} }

In maize, this was achieved through selection for a gain-of-function allele of the TCP transcription factor teosinte branched1 (tb1).

Through ChIP seq, RNA seq, hormone and sugar measurements on 1 mm axillary bud tissue, we identify the genetic pathways putatively regulated by TB1. These include pathways regulating phytohormones such as gibberellins, abscisic acid and jasmonic acid, but surprisingly, not auxin. In addition, metabolites involved in sugar sensing such as trehalose 6-phosphate were increased. This suggests that TB1 induces bud suppression through the production of inhibitory phytohormones and by reducing sugar levels and energy balance. Interestingly, TB1 also putatively targets several other domestication loci, including teosinte glume architecture1, prol1.1/grassy tillers1, as well as itself.

Under domestication, wild populations respond to shifting selective pressures, resulting in adaptation to the new ecological niche of cultivation. Owing to the important role of domesticated crops in human nutrition and agriculture, the ancestry and selection pressures transforming a wild plant into a domesticate have been extensively studied. In Zea mays, morphological, genetic and genomic studies have elucidated how a wild plant, the teosinte Z. mays subsp. parviglumis, was transformed into the domesticate Z. mays subsp. mays. Five major morphological differences distinguish these two subspecies, and careful genetic dissection has pinpointed the molecular changes responsible for several of these traits. But maize domestication was a consequence of more than just five genes, and regions throughout the genome contribute. The impacts of these additional regions are contingent on genetic background, both the interactions between alleles of a single gene and among alleles of the multiple genes that modulate phenotypes. Key genetic interactions include dominance relationships, epistatic interactions and pleiotropic constraint, including how these variants are connected in gene networks. Here, we review the role of gene interactions in generating the dramatic phenotypic evolution seen in the transition from teosinte to maize.}, number={2}, journal={New Phytologist}, author={Stitzer, Michelle C. and Ross-Ibarra, Jeffrey}, year={2018}, pages={395–408} }

Here, we mined the determinants of local adaptation at the genomewide scale in the two closest maize wild relatives, the teosintes Zea mays ssp parviglumis and ssp. mexicana. We sequenced 120 individuals from six populations: two lowland, two intermediate and two highland populations sampled along two altitudinal gradients. We detected 8 479 581 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) covered in the six populations with an average sequencing depth per site per population ranging from 17.0× to 32.2×. Population diversity varied from 0.10 to 0.15, and linkage disequilibrium decayed very rapidly. We combined two differentiation-based methods, and correlation of allele frequencies with environmental variables to detect outlier SNPs. Outlier SNPs displayed significant clustering. From clusters, we identified 47 candidate regions. We further modified a haplotype-based method to incorporate genotype uncertainties in haplotype calling, and applied it to candidate regions. We retrieved evidence for selection at the haplotype level in 53\% of our candidate regions, and in 70\% of the cases the same haplotype was selected in the two lowland or the two highland populations. We recovered a candidate region located within a previously characterized inversion on chromosome 1. We found evidence of a soft sweep at a locus involved in leaf macrohair variation. Finally, our results revealed frequent colocalization between our candidate regions and loci involved in the variation of traits associated with plant–soil interactions such as root morphology, aluminium and low phosphorus tolerance.

Maize leaves produce three distinct types of hairs, the most prominent being the macrohairs that serve as a marker for adult leaf identity and may contribute to insect resistance. This report describes the maize macrohairless1 (mhl1) locus, which promotes macrohair initiation specifically in the leaf blade. Each of seven recessive mhl1 mutant alleles significantly reduces or eliminates macrohairs in the leaf blade. The mhl1 mutations block macrohair initiation rather than interfering with macrohair morphogenesis. Genetic mapping placed mhl1 within bin 4 on chromosome 9. A second independently segregating locus was found to partially suppress the mhl1 mutant phenotype in certain genetic backgrounds. Macrohair density was observed to increase during early adult vegetative development and then progressively decline, suggesting macrohair initiation frequency is affected by factors that act throughout shoot development. Genetic analyses demonstrated that mhl1 acts in the same pathway but downstream of factors that either promote or repress adult leaf identity. Thus, mhl1 plays a key role in integrating developmental programs that regulate leaf identity during shoot development with those that specify macrohair initiation within the leaf blade.}, number={3}, journal={Genetics}, publisher={Genetics}, author={Moose, Stephen P. and Lauter, Nick and Carlson, Shawn R.}, year={2004}, month={Mar}, pages={1451–1461} }

These character states may represent adaptations to the cooler highland (Chalco) vs. warmer middle-elevation (Balsas) climates. QTL mapping in multiple populations revealed a mix of major- and minor-effect QTL affecting both sheath color (anthocyanin) and macrohair abundance. The major QTL for macrohairs accounts for 52\% of the parental difference. Epistatic interactions were detected between the major-effect QTL and multiple other QTL for both traits, accounting for substantial portions of phenotypic variance. Developmental analyses suggest that regulatory program changes underlie the phenotypic differences. Sheath anthocyanin QTL are clearly associated with b1 and a3, both of which are regulators of anthocyanin biosynthesis.

Inversions can capture multiple locally adaptive functional variants in a linked block by repressing recombination. However, this recombination suppression makes it difficult to identify the genetic mechanisms underlying an inversion’s role in adaptation. In this study, we used large-scale transcriptomic data to dissect the functional importance of a 13 Mb inversion locus (Inv4m) found almost exclusively in highland populations of maize (Zea mays ssp. mays). Inv4m was introgressed into highland maize from the wild relative Zea mays ssp. mexicana, also present in the highlands of Mexico, and is thought to be important for the adaptation of these populations to cultivation in highland environments. However, the specific genetic variants and traits that underlie this adaptation are not known. We created two families segregating for the standard and inverted haplotypes of Inv4m in a common genetic background and measured gene expression effects associated with the inversion across 9 tissues in two experimental conditions. With these data, we quantified both the global transcriptomic effects of the highland Inv4m haplotype, and the local cis-regulatory variation present within the locus. We found diverse physiological effects of Inv4m across the 9 tissues, including a strong effect on the expression of genes involved in photosynthesis and chloroplast physiology. Although we could not confidently identify the causal alleles within Inv4m, this research accelerates progress towards understanding this inversion and will guide future research on these important genomic features.}, number={12}, journal={PLOS Genetics}, publisher={Public Library of Science}, author={Crow, Taylor and Ta, James and Nojoomi, Saghi and Aguilar-Rangel, M.

In this study, we use genome-wide capture of nuclear gene sequences, plus skimming of organellar sequences, to investigate the phylogenomics of monkeyflowers in Mimulus section Erythranthe (27 accessions from seven species). Taxa within Erythranthe, particularly the parapatric and putatively sister species M. lewisii (bee-pollinated) and M. cardinalis (hummingbird-pollinated), have been a model system for investigating the ecological genetics of speciation and adaptation for over five decades. Across >8000 nuclear loci, multiple methods resolve a predominant species tree in which M. cardinalis groups with other hummingbird-pollinated taxa (37\% of gene trees), rather than being sister to M. lewisii (32\% of gene trees). We independently corroborate a single evolution of hummingbird pollination syndrome in Erythranthe by demonstrating functional redundancy in genetic complementation tests of floral traits in hybrids; together, these analyses overturn a textbook case of pollination-syndrome convergence. Strong asymmetries in allele-sharing (Patterson’s D-statistic and related tests) indicate that gene-tree discordance reflects ancient and recent introgression rather than incomplete lineage sorting. Consistent with abundant introgression blurring the history of divergence, low-recombination and adaptation-associated regions support the new species tree, while high-recombination regions generate phylogenetic evidence for sister status for M. lewisii and M. cardinalis. Population-level sampling of core taxa also revealed two instances of chloroplast capture, with Sierran M. lewisii and Southern Californian M. parishii each carrying organelle genomes nested within respective sympatric M. cardinalis clades. A recent organellar transfer from M. cardinalis, an outcrosser where selfish cytonuclear dynamics are more likely, may account for the unexpected cytoplasmic male sterility effects of selfer M. parishii organelles in hybrids with M. lewisii. Overall, our phylogenomic results reveal extensive reticulation throughout the evolutionary history of a classic monkeyflower radiation, suggesting that natural selection (re-)assembles and maintains species-diagnostic traits and barriers in the face of gene flow.

Through comparative genomics, mutant analysis, genetic analysis and QTL cloning, and transgenic approaches, more than 30 flowering time candidate genes in maize have been revealed and the relationships among these genes have been partially uncovered. Based on the knowledge of the flowering time candidate genes, a conceptual gene regulatory network model for the genetic control of flowering time in maize is proposed. To demonstrate the potential of the proposed gene regulatory network model, a first attempt was made to develop a dynamic gene network model to predict flowering time of maize genotypes varying for specific genes. The dynamic gene network model is composed of four genes and was built on the basis of gene expression dynamics of the two late flowering id1 and dlf1 mutants, the early flowering landrace Gaspe Flint and the temperate inbred B73. The model was evaluated against the phenotypic data of the id1 dlf1 double mutant and the ZMM4 overexpressed transgenic lines.

Inference of population structure is essential in both population genetics and association studies, and is often performed using principal component analysis (PCA) or clustering-based approaches. NGS methods provide large amounts of genetic data but are associated with statistical uncertainty, especially for low-depth sequencing data. Models can account for this uncertainty by working directly on genotype likelihoods of the unobserved genotypes. We propose a method for inferring population structure through PCA in an iterative heuristic approach of estimating individual allele frequencies, where we demonstrate improved accuracy in samples with low and variable sequencing depth for both simulated and real datasets. We also use the estimated individual allele frequencies in a fast non-negative matrix factorization method to estimate admixture proportions.

This article provides context from phylogenetic and population genetic theory. I review how F-statistics can be interpreted as branch lengths or paths and derive new interpretations, using coalescent theory. I further show that the admixture tests can be interpreted as testing general properties of phylogenies, allowing extension of some ideas applications to arbitrary phylogenetic trees. The new results are used to investigate the behavior of the statistics under different models of population structure and show how population substructure complicates inference.

Here, we ask how domestication has altered genetic architecture by comparing the genetic architecture of 18 domestication traits in maize and its ancestor teosinte using matched populations. We observed a strongly reduced number of QTL for domestication traits in maize relative to teosinte, which is consistent with the previously reported depletion of additive variance by selection during domestication. We also observed more dominance in maize than teosinte, likely a consequence of selective removal of additive variants. We observed that large effect QTL have low minor allele frequency (MAF) in both maize and teosinte. Regions of the genome that are strongly differentiated between teosinte and maize (high FST) explain less quantitative variation in maize than teosinte, suggesting that, in these regions, allelic variants were brought to (or near) fixation during domestication. We also observed that genomic regions of high recombination explain a disproportionately large proportion of heritable variance both before and after domestication. Finally, we observed that about 75\% of the additive variance in both teosinte and maize is “missing” in the sense that it cannot be ascribed to detectable QTL and only 25\% of variance maps to specific QTL.

In the decades that followed, a number of papers provided differing definitions, estimation methods, and interpretations beyond Wright’s. While this diversity in methods has enabled many studies in genetics, it has also introduced confusion regarding how to estimate FST from available data. Considering this confusion, wide variation in published estimates of FST for pairs of HapMap populations is a cause for concern. These estimates changed—in some cases more than twofold—when comparing estimates from genotyping arrays to those from sequence data. Indeed, changes in FST from sequencing data might be expected due to population genetic factors affecting rare variants. While rare variants do influence the result, we show that this is largely through differences in estimation methods. Correcting for this yields estimates of FST that are much more concordant between sequence and genotype data. These differences relate to three specific issues: (1) estimating FST for a single SNP, (2) combining estimates of FST across multiple SNPs, and (3) selecting the set of SNPs used in the computation. Changes in each of these aspects of estimation may result in FST estimates that are highly divergent from one another.

The annual tropical teosintes, the closest wild relatives of maize, were recently reported as new agricultural weeds in two European countries, Spain and France. Their prompt settlement under climatic conditions differing drastically from that of their native range indicates rapid genetic evolution. We performed a phenotypic comparison of French and Mexican teosintes under European conditions and showed that only the former could complete their life cycle during maize cropping season. To test the hypothesis that crop-to-wild introgression triggered such rapid adaptation, we used single nucleotide polymorphisms to characterize patterns of genetic variation in French, Spanish, and Mexican teosintes as well as in maize germplasm. We showed that both Spanish and French teosintes originated from Zea mays ssp. mexicana race “Chalco,” a weedy teosinte from the Mexican highlands. However, introduced teosintes differed markedly from their Mexican source by elevated levels of genetic introgression from the high latitude Dent maize grown in Europe. We identified a clear signature of divergent selection in a region of chromosome 8 introgressed from maize and encompassing ZCN8, a major flowering time gene associated with adaptation to high latitudes. Moreover, herbicide assays and sequencing revealed that French teosintes have acquired herbicide resistance via the introgression of a mutant herbicide-target gene (ACC1) present in herbicide-resistant maize cultivars. Altogether, our results demonstrate that adaptive crop-to-wild introgression has triggered both rapid adaptation to a new climatic niche and acquisition of herbicide resistance, thereby fostering the establishment of an emerging noxious weed.}, number={41}, journal={Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences}, author={Le Corre, Valérie and Siol, Mathieu and Vigouroux, Yves and Tenaillon, Maud I. and Délye, Christophe}, year={2020}, month={Oct}, pages={25618–25627} }

A comparison of genetic diversity between the landrace and inbred samples showed that inbreds retained 77\% of the level of diversity of landraces, on average. In addition, Tajima’s D values suggest that the frequency distribution of polymorphisms in inbreds was skewed toward fewer rare variants. Tests for selection were applied to all loci, and deviations from neutrality were detected in three loci. Sequence diversity was heterogeneous among loci, but there was no pattern of diversity along the genetic map of chromosome 1. Nonetheless, diversity was correlated (r = 0.65) with sequence-based estimates of the recombination rate. Recombination in our sample was sufficient to break down linkage disequilibrium among SNPs.

We grew half-sibling teosinte families in each biota to test whether trait divergence among teosinte populations reflects adaptation or drift, and whether rhizosphere biota affect expression of diverged traits. We further assayed the influence of rhizosphere biota on contemporary additive genetic variation. We found that adaptation across environment shaped divergence of some traits, particularly flowering time and root biomass. We also observed that different rhizosphere biota shifted expressed values of these traits within teosinte populations and families and altered within-population genetic variance and covariance.

Introgression can also erode species differences over time, but selection against introgression at certain loci acts to maintain postmating species barriers. Theory predicts that species barriers made up of many loci throughout the genome should lead to a broad correlation between introgression and recombination rate, which determines the extent to which selection on deleterious foreign alleles will affect neutral alleles at physically linked loci. Here, we describe the variation in genealogical relationships across the genome among three species of Heliconius butterflies: H. melpomene (mel), H. cydno (cyd), and H. timareta (tim), using whole genomes of 92 individuals, and ask whether this variation can be explained by heterogeneous barriers to introgression. We find that species relationships vary predictably at the chromosomal scale. By quantifying recombination rate and admixture proportions, we then show that rates of introgression are predicted by variation in recombination rate. This implies that species barriers are highly polygenic, with selection acting against introgressed alleles across most of the genome. In addition, long chromosomes, which have lower recombination rates, produce stronger barriers on average than short chromosomes. Finally, we find a consistent difference between two species pairs on either side of the Andes, which suggests differences in the architecture of the species barriers. Our findings illustrate how the combined effects of hybridisation, recombination, and natural selection, acting at multitudes of loci over long periods, can dramatically sculpt the phylogenetic relationships among species.}, number={2}, journal={PLOS Biology}, publisher={Public Library of Science}, author={Martin, Simon H. and Davey, John W. and Salazar, Camilo and Jiggins, Chris D.}, year={2019}, month={Feb}, pages={e2006288} }

The role of hybridization in evolution and species radiations has long been debated. In Heliconius butterflies, introgression was a major factor in their radiation, and the genetic variation it imparted into species is variable across the genome. Edelman et al. developed a new sequencing strategy and produced 20 Heliconius genomes (see the Perspective by Rieseberg). They also developed a means by which to identify genetic variation that originates from incomplete lineage sorting versus hybridization. Applying this model to their newly developed genomes, they investigated the evolutionary history of the genus and, in particular, the impact of introgression.
Science, this issue p. 594; see also p. 570
We used 20 de novo genome assemblies to probe the speciation history and architecture of gene flow in rapidly radiating Heliconius butterflies. Our tests to distinguish incomplete lineage sorting from introgression indicate that gene flow has obscured several ancient phylogenetic relationships in this group over large swathes of the genome. Introgressed loci are underrepresented in low-recombination and gene-rich regions, consistent with the purging of foreign alleles more tightly linked to incompatibility loci. Here, we identify a hitherto unknown inversion that traps a color pattern switch locus. We infer that this inversion was transferred between lineages by introgression and is convergent with a similar rearrangement in another part of the genus. These multiple de novo genome sequences enable improved understanding of the importance of introgression and selective processes in adaptive radiation.

Here, we use DNA polymorphism data and genome-wide variation in recombination rate to jointly infer the strength and timing of selection, as well as the baseline level of gene flow under various demographic scenarios. We model how divergent selection leads to a genome-wide negative correlation between recombination rate and genetic differentiation among populations. Our theory shows that the selection density (i.e., the selection coefficient per base pair) is a key parameter underlying this relationship. We then develop a procedure for parameter estimation that accounts for the confounding effect of background selection. Applying this method to two datasets from Mimulus guttatus, we infer a strong signal of adaptive divergence in the face of gene flow between populations growing on and off phytotoxic serpentine soils. However, the genome-wide intensity of this selection is not exceptional compared with what M. guttatus populations may typically experience when adapting to local conditions. We also find that selection against genome-wide introgression from the selfing sister species M. nasutus has acted to maintain a barrier between these two species over at least the last 250 ky.

Using whole transcriptomes from all 13 species in the ecologically and reproductively diverse wild tomato clade (Solanum sect. Lycopersicon), we infer the species phylogeny and patterns of genetic diversity in this group. Despite widespread phylogenetic discordance due to the sorting of ancestral variation, we date the origin of this radiation to approximately 2.5 million years ago and find evidence for at least three sources of adaptive genetic variation that fuel diversification. First, we detect introgression both historically between early-branching lineages and recently between individual populations, at specific loci whose functions indicate likely adaptive benefits. Second, we find evidence of lineage-specific de novo evolution for many genes, including loci involved in the production of red fruit color. Finally, using a “PhyloGWAS” approach, we detect environment-specific sorting of ancestral variation among populations that come from different species but share common environmental conditions. Estimated across the whole clade, small but substantial and approximately equal fractions of the euchromatic portion of the genome are inferred to contribute to each of these three sources of adaptive genetic variation.

Here, we describe and evaluate the hypothesis that hybridization between species can contribute to species range expansion.

We here demonstrate that biodiversity within all globally known strains of Schizosaccharomyces pombe arose through admixture between two divergent ancestral lineages. Initial hybridization was inferred to have occurred ∼20–60 sexual outcrossing generations ago consistent with recent, human-induced migration at the onset of intensified transcontinental trade. Species-wide heritable phenotypic variation was explained near-exclusively by strain-specific arrangements of alternating ancestry components with evidence for transgressive segregation. Reproductive compatibility between strains was likewise predicted by the degree of shared ancestry. To assess the genetic determinants of ancestry block distribution across the genome, we characterized the type, frequency, and position of structural genomic variation using nanopore and single-molecule real-time sequencing. Despite being associated with double-strand break initiation points, over 800 segregating structural variants exerted overall little influence on the introgression landscape or on reproductive compatibility between strains. In contrast, we found strong ancestry disequilibrium consistent with negative epistatic selection shaping genomic ancestry combinations during the course of hybridization. This study provides a detailed, experimentally tractable example that genomes of natural populations are mosaics reflecting different evolutionary histories.

Deleterious gene interactions may underlie the observed hybrid incompatibilities. However, few genes underlying hybrid incompatibilities have been identified, and most of these involve species that do not hybridize in natural conditions. Powell et al. used genome sequencing to map genes likely responsible for incompatibilities that reduce fitness in naturally occurring hybrid swordtail fish. These gene combinations result in malignant melanoma, which is found in naturally hybridizing populations but is not present in the parental populations (see the Perspective by Dagilis and Matute). Using genome and population resequencing, the authors performed a genome-wide association study to identify potentially causative mutations. Using an admixture mapping approach that assessed introgression between multiple swordtail fish species, the authors suggest that lineages carry different genes that interact with the same candidate gene, resulting in the observed melanomas and providing insight into convergent hybrid incompatibles that arise between species.

Most of the significant SNP associations were to temperature and to phosphorus concentration in the soil.

We have discovered a simple genetic incompatibility that causes lethality in hybrids between two closely related species of yellow monkeyflower (Mimulus guttatus and M. nasutus). This hybrid incompatibility, which causes one sixteenth of F2 hybrid seedlings to lack chlorophyll and die shortly after germination, occurs between sympatric populations that are connected by ongoing interspecific gene flow. Using complimentary genetic mapping and gene expression analyses, we show that lethality occurs in hybrids that lack a functional copy of the critical photosynthetic gene pTAC14. In M. guttatus, this gene was duplicated, but the ancestral copy is no longer expressed. In M. nasutus, the duplication is missing altogether. As a result, hybrids die when they are homozygous for the nonfunctional M. guttatus copy and missing the duplicate from M. nasutus, apparently due to misregulated transcription of key photosynthetic genes. Our study indicates that neutral evolutionary processes may play an important role in the evolution of hybrid incompatibilities and opens the door to direct investigations of their contribution to reproductive isolation among naturally hybridizing species.}, number={4}, journal={PLOS Genetics}, publisher={Public Library of Science}, author={Zuellig, Matthew P. and Sweigart, Andrea L.}, year={2018}, month={Apr}, pages={e1007130} }

We identified two flavones that are induced by UV-B in leaves of high-altitude lines: maysin and its biosynthetic precursor rhamnosylisoorientin. Accumulation is controlled by a p-homologous transcription factor expressed in leaves, and this factor is regulated by UV-B. The levels of either maysin or rhamnosylisoorientin are higher in seedling leaves than in subsequent leaves; the highest flavone concentration was detected in silks. Some landraces have only rhamnosylisoorientin; this likely reflects a mutation in salmon silk1 (sm1) or in a duplicate locus, as genetic crosses with W23 restore the production of maysin in heterozygous F1 plants.

The Green Revolution has played a key role in the past century by increasing agricultural productivity worldwide, however, limited availability and continued depletion of natural resources such as arable land and water will continue to pose a serious challenge for global food security in the coming decades. High yielding varieties with proven tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses, superior nutritional profiles, and the ability to adapt to the changing environment are needed for continued agricultural sustainability. The narrow genetic base of modern cultivars is becoming a major bottleneck for crop improvement efforts and, therefore, the use of crop wild relatives (CWRs) is a promising approach to enhance genetic diversity of cultivated crops. This article provides a review of the efforts to date on the exploration of CWRs as a source of tolerance to multiple biotic and abiotic stresses in four global crops of importance; maize, rice, cotton, and soybean. In addition to the overview of the repertoire and geographical spread of CWRs in each of the respective crops, we have provided a comprehensive discussion on the morphological and/or genetic basis of the traits along with some examples, when available, of the research in the transfer of traits from CWRs to cultivated varieties. The emergence of modern molecular and genomic technologies has not only accelerated the pace of dissecting the genetics underlying the traits found in CWRs, but also enabled rapid and efficient trait transfer and genome manipulation. The potential and promise of these technologies has also been highlighted in this review.}, journal={Frontiers in Plant Science}, publisher={Frontiers}, author={Mammadov, Jafar and Buyyarapu, Ramesh and Guttikonda, Satish K. and Parliament, Kelly and Abdurakhmonov, Ibrokhim Y. and Kumpatla, Siva P.}, year={2018} }

This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses — the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferronitype procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.}, number={1}, journal={Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series B (Methodological)}, author={Benjamini, Yoav and Hochberg, Yosef}, year={1995}, pages={289–300} }

 title={Early Development of Leaf Trichomes Is Associated With Decreased Damage in Teosinte, Compared With Maize, by Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae)}, volume={109}, ISSN={0013-8746, 1938-2901}, DOI={10.1093/aesa/saw049}, abstractNote={Invertebrate herbivores prefer younger over older plant stages. Therefore, defensive traits against herbivores during early plant ontogeny are important. Defensive chemical and physical traits are well-studied in domesticated plants, but not in their wild relatives. Little is known about the function of trichomes, a physical defense against herbivore arthropods that damage cultivated plants and their wild ancestors. Maize is one of the most important crops in the world, but few studies have been conducted on the physical defenses during early ontogeny of maize and its wild relative teosinte. Therefore, the objective of this study was to characterize the density of trichomes (macrohairs) in maize and teosintes, and to evaluate the chewing damage by Spodoptera frugiperda (Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) larvae on the 6-leaf stage of 1) perennial teosinte Zea perennis (Poaceae), 2) annual teosinte Zea mays ssp. parviglumis, 3) landrace maize, and 4) on the 2-leaf stage of the landrace maize. Signiﬁcantly less damage occurred in both teosinte species, which showed pubescence (trichomes) on the upper leaf-blade, but not on the midrib leaf surface. The highest trichome density was found on Z. perennis, followed by Z. mays ssp. parviglumis at the 6-leaf stage. No trichomes were found on the landrace maize, at the 6-leaf stage or 2-leaf stage. Results suggest that trichomes play an important role in preventing damage by chewing larvae on the ancestors of maize. Genes that promote macrohair initiation in teosintes during early vegetative development could be incorporated into maize plants in the future.}, number={5}, journal={Annals of the Entomological Society of America}, author={Moya-Raygoza, Gustavo}, year={2016}, month={Sep}, pages={737–743} }

Curation and development efforts have targeted high quality datasets and tools to support maize trait analysis, germplasm analysis, genetic studies, and breeding. MaizeGDB hosts a wide range of data including recent support of new data types including genome metadata, RNA-seq, proteomics, synteny, and large-scale diversity. To improve access and visualization of data types several new tools have been implemented to: access large-scale maize diversity data (SNPversity), download and compare gene expression data (qTeller), visualize pedigree data (Pedigree Viewer), link genes with phenotype images (MaizeDIG), and enable flexible user-specified queries to the MaizeGDB database (MaizeMine). MaizeGDB also continues to be the community hub for maize research, coordinating activities and providing technical support to the maize research community. Here we report the changes MaizeGDB has made within the last three years to keep pace with recent software and research advances, as well as the pan-genomic landscape that cheaper and better sequencing technologies have made possible.
